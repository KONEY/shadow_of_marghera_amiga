------- NO TEXTSCROLLER ON INTRO SO TXT HERE: ---------
THIS PIECE OF INTRO FOR AMIGA FEATURES AN ENDLESS WRAPPING SCROLL. EVERY POSSIBLE BYTE HAS BEEN OPTIMIZED AND USED FOR GFX.
THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 8 SCREENS @2 BITPLANES, 1 @1 BITPLANE AND 16 SCREENS @3 BITPLANES! IN ORDER TO FIT ALL THESE GFX IN 512KB
EVERY POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATION HAS BEEN MADE, FROM CUSTOM SCROLLING ROUTINES TO SAMPLES/ SCORE SEPARATION IN
MUSIC FILE. AS USUAL, THE MUSIC TRACK WAS COMPOSED IN OCTAMED SOUNDSTUDIO IN 1998 THEREFORE OCTAMED PLAYROUTINES
HAVE BEEN USED AGAIN. AS IT'S POSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT, THIS IS SOMEHOW A TRIBUTE TO SHADOW OF THE BEAST 2 FROM PSYGNOSIS!
VISUALZ ARE MAINLY INSPIRED TO PORTO MARGHERA WHICH IS VENICE INDUSTRIAL ZONE BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY BRUTALIST ICONS
FROM AROUND EUROPE... MOST OF THEM I WITNESSED IN PERSON.
